# Task MCP — Project Pack (Clean, Pampax-Separated)

_Last updated: 2025-10-23_

This archive contains a **Task MCP–only** plan: clear goals, phases, error codes, schemas, security, and implementation pseudocode.
It also includes a small `/integrations/pampax/` directory with **advisory markdown** for Pampax to index/consume Task MCP artifacts.
Those docs do not alter the Task MCP plan or API and are explicitly optional.

**Start here:** `PROJECT_OVERVIEW_TASK_MCP.md`, then browse `phases/` and `docs/`.
