# Service Level Objectives (SLOs) Guide - Task MCP HTTP Server

This guide provides comprehensive documentation for Service Level Objectives (SLOs), Service Level Indicators (SLIs), and error budget management for the Task MCP HTTP server.

## Overview

Service Level Objectives (SLOs) are critical for ensuring the reliability and performance of the Task MCP HTTP server. This guide explains how SLOs are defined, measured, and used to drive operational decisions.

## SLO Framework

### Key Concepts

#### Service Level Indicator (SLI)
A carefully defined quantitative measure of service level:
- **Metric**: What we measure (e.g., request latency, error rate)
- **Measurement**: How we calculate it (e.g., 95th percentile)
- **Period**: Time window for measurement (e.g., 30 days)

#### Service Level Objective (SLO)
Target value or range of values for a service level:
- **Target**: The goal we want to achieve (e.g., 99.9% availability)
- **Period**: Time window over which we measure (e.g., 30 days rolling)
- **Criticality**: Business impact of missing the target

#### Error Budget
The amount of failure we can tolerate within an SLO period:
- **Calculation**: (100% - SLO target) Ã— period
- **Usage**: How much of the budget has been consumed
- **Burn Rate**: Rate at which we're consuming the budget

## SLO Definitions

### 1. Availability SLOs

#### API Endpoints Availability
```yaml
slo_name: "API Endpoints Availability"
target: 99.9%
measurement_period: 30d (rolling)
sli: "Percentage of successful HTTP requests (2xx status codes)"
error_budget: "0.1% (43.2 minutes/month)"
criticality: "High"
```

**Calculation:**
```promql
# Success Rate
sum(rate(http_server_requests_total{status=~"2.."}[30d])) /
sum(rate(http_server_requests_total[30d])) * 100

# Error Budget Consumption
(1 - (sum(rate(http_server_requests_total{status=~"2.."}[30d])) /
      sum(rate(http_server_requests_total[30d]))) * 30 * 24 * 60
```

#### Health Check Availability
```yaml
slo_name: "Health Check Availability"
target: 99.95%
measurement_period: 30d (rolling)
sli: "Percentage of successful health check responses"
error_budget: "0.05% (21.6 minutes/month)"
criticality: "Critical"
```

**Calculation:**
```promql
# Health Check Success Rate
sum(rate(http_requests_total{route=~"/health/.*",status=~"2.."}[30d])) /
sum(rate(http_requests_total{route=~"/health/.*"}[30d])) * 100
```

measurement_period: 7d (rolling)
sli: "95th/99th percentile of tool execution duration"
error_budget: "N/A (threshold-based)"
criticality: "High"
```

**Calculation:**
```promql
# Tool Execution p95 Latency
histogram_quantile(0.95,
  sum(rate(tool_execution_duration_bucket[7d])) by (le)
)
```

#### Streaming Response Latency
```yaml
slo_name: "Streaming Response Latency"
target: "p95 < 100ms for first message"

criticality: "High"
```

**Calculation:**
```promql

target: "> 1000 concurrent SSE connections"
measurement_period: 24h (rolling)
sli: "Maximum concurrent streaming connections"
error_budget: "N/A (threshold-based)"
criticality: "Medium"
```

**Calculation:**
```promql
# Concurrent Connections
sum(streaming_active_connections)
```

## Error Budget Management

### Error Budget Calculations

#### Monthly Error Budget Examples

| SLO | Target | Monthly Budget | Daily Budget | Hourly Budget |
|-----|--------|----------------|--------------|---------------|
| API Availability | 99.9% | 43.2 minutes | 1.44 minutes | 2.4 seconds |
| Health Checks | 99.95% | 21.6 minutes | 43.2 seconds | 0.72 seconds |
| HTTP Error Rate | 1% | 432 minutes | 14.4 minutes | 24 seconds |
| Tool Error Rate | 0.1% | 43.2 minutes | 1.44 minutes | 2.4 seconds |

### Burn Rate Monitoring

#### Burn Rate Calculation
```promql
# Current Error Rate (1h window)
current_error_rate = 
  sum(rate(http_server_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[1h])) /
  sum(rate(http_server_requests_total[1h]))

# SLO Error Rate (1% = 0.01)
slo_error_rate = 0.01

# Burn Rate
burn_rate = current_error_rate / slo_error_rate
```

#### Burn Rate Alert Thresholds

| Alert Type | Burn Rate | Time to Exhaust Budget | Alert Severity |
|------------|-----------|------------------------|----------------|
| Fast Burn | > 14.4x | < 2 hours | Critical |
| Medium Burn | > 4.8x | < 6 hours | Warning |
| Slow Burn | > 1.2x | < 24 hours | Info |

#### Alert Rules
```yaml
# Fast Burn Alert (1 hour window)
- alert: TaskMCPHighErrorRateFastBurn
  expr: |
    (
      sum(rate(http_server_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[1h])) /
      sum(rate(http_server_requests_total[1h]))
    ) / 0.01 > 14.4
  for: 2m
  labels:
    severity: critical
  annotations:
    summary: "Fast error budget burn detected"
    description: "Error budget will be exhausted in less than 2 hours"

# Medium Burn Alert (6 hour window)
- alert: TaskMCPHighErrorRateMediumBurn
  expr: |
    (
      sum(rate(http_server_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[6h])) /
      sum(rate(http_server_requests_total[6h]))
    ) / 0.01 > 4.8
  for: 10m
  labels:
    severity: warning
  annotations:
    summary: "Medium error budget burn detected"
    description: "Error budget will be exhausted in less than 6 hours"
```

#### When Error Budget is Consuming (20-50% remaining)
- **Caution**: Increased testing and monitoring
- **Pace**: Slower deployment velocity
- **Monitoring**: Enhanced alerting and thresholds

#### When Error Budget is Low (< 20% remaining)
- **Conservative**: Only critical fixes and security patches
- **Pace**: Minimal deployment velocity
- **Monitoring**: Maximum alerting sensitivity

#### When Error Budget is Exhausted
- **Freeze**: All non-essential deployments halted
- **Focus**: Reliability improvements only
- **Recovery**: Full incident response mode

### SLO-Driven Development

#### Feature Release Criteria
1. **SLO Impact Assessment**: Evaluate impact on SLOs
2. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing including SLO impact
3. **Monitoring**: Enhanced monitoring during rollout
4. **Rollback**: Quick rollback capability

#### Risk Tolerance Matrix
