# Phase 3 Implementation Plan - Resources & IDE UX

_Last updated: 2025-10-24_

## Goals
Polish `changes://active` pagination; ensure IDE resource UX is smooth.

## Tasks & RACI
- **Builder**: Implement `changes://active?page=&pageSize=` with stable sort and `nextPageToken`
- **Engineer**: Add streaming resource readers for large files (no buffer bloat)  
- **Knowledge**: IDE guide for resource attach (Task MCP only)

## Implementation Tasks (â‰¤4h each)

### Task 1: Pagination Implementation for changes://active
```typescript
{
  description: "Implement stable pagination with nextPageToken for changes://active resource",
  prompt: "Enhance the ChangesResourceProvider to support pagination parameters (page, pageSize) with stable sorting and nextPageToken generation. The implementation must: 1) Parse page and pageSize from URI query parameters with defaults (page=1, pageSize=50), 2) Implement stable sorting by modified date descending with consistent tie-breaking, 3) Generate secure nextPageToken for navigation, 4) Maintain backward compatibility for existing consumers, 5) Add comprehensive error handling for invalid parameters. Reference the existing ChangesResourceProvider in src/stdio/resources/changes-resource.ts and follow established patterns from the codebase.",
  subagent_type: "Builder",
  provides: ["pagination-infrastructure", "stable-sort-algorithm", "token-generation"],
  depends_on: [],
  acceptance: [
    "changes://active?page=1&pageSize=20 returns first 20 changes sorted by modified date desc",
    "changes://active?page=2&pageSize=20 returns next 20 changes with consistent ordering",
    "nextPageToken is present when more pages exist and absent on last page",
    "Invalid page/pageSize parameters return proper error responses",
    "Backward compatibility maintained for changes://active without parameters",
    "Performance tests show <100ms response time for 1000+ changes"
  ]
}
```

### Task 2: Streaming Resource Readers for Large Files
```typescript

  ]
}
```

### Task 3: Enhanced Error Handling and Validation
```typescript

2. **Pagination Token Stability**
   - Risk: nextPageToken could become invalid during change modifications
   - Mitigation: Use content-based hashing and version-aware tokens
   - Owner: Builder
   - Contingency: Implement token regeneration on invalid token detection

### Medium Risk Items
3. **IDE Compatibility Across Platforms**
   - Risk: Different IDEs may handle pagination/streaming differently
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing across all supported platforms
   - Owner: Knowledge
   - Contingency: Platform-specific workarounds documented

4. **Performance Under Load**
   - Risk: Concurrent IDE access could degrade performance
   - Mitigation: Implement connection pooling and request queuing
   - Owner: Engineer
   - Contingency: Rate limiting and caching strategies

### Low Risk Items
5. **Backward Compatibility**
