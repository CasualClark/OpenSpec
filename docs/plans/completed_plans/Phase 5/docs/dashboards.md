# Dashboards (starter)

- **Service**: req/s, error rate, p50/p95/p99; SLO and error‑budget remaining.
- **Transport**: SSE/NDJSON connections, heartbeats, bytes out.
- **Tools**: success/errors and latency by `tool.name`.
- **Reliability**: ELOCKED count, TTL expiries, retries/backoff.
- **System**: CPU time, heap bytes, open FDs, event‑loop lag.
