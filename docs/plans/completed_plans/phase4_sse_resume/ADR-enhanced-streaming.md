# ADR: Enhanced Streaming Architecture Implementation

## Status
Proposed

## Date
2025-10-25

## Context

OpenSpec's current streaming implementation provides solid basic functionality but requires enhancement for production-grade workloads involving large files (>100MB), concurrent streaming, and robust error recovery. The existing `StreamingReader` in `src/stdio/resources/streaming-reader.ts` handles basic file streaming but lacks adaptive optimization, comprehensive backpressure handling, and systematic recovery mechanisms.

## Decision

We will implement an **Enhanced Memory-First Architecture** that extends the existing streaming foundation with adaptive capabilities while maintaining full backward compatibility.

## Architectural Decisions

### 1. Chunk Size Strategy: Adaptive Sizing
**Decision**: Replace fixed 64KB chunks with adaptive sizing based on file size, memory pressure, and throughput performance.

**File Size Classes**:
- <1MB: 32KB chunks (reduced memory for small files)
- 1-10MB: 64KB chunks (current default, optimal balance)
- 10-100MB: 128KB chunks (improved throughput for medium files)
- â‰¥100MB: 256KB chunks (maximum efficiency for large files)

**Rationale**: Empirical testing shows 64KB provides optimal memory/throughput balance, but different file sizes benefit from different chunk sizes. Adaptive sizing allows optimization based on system conditions.

**Tradeoffs**: Increased complexity for significant performance gains and memory efficiency.

### 2. Memory Thresholds: Multi-Level System
**Decision**: Implement multi-level threshold system with 1MB streaming trigger.

**Threshold Levels**:
- Streaming trigger: 1MB (reduced from current 10MB)
- Warning threshold: 60% heap usage
- Critical threshold: 75% heap usage
- Emergency threshold: 85% heap usage
- Absolute limit: 50MB per operation

**Rationale**: Lower streaming trigger prevents memory buildup. Multi-level thresholds enable proactive backpressure application before critical situations.

**Tradeoffs**: More aggressive streaming increases overhead but provides better memory safety and system stability.

### 3. Backpressure: Multi-Factor Control
**Decision**: Replace single-factor backpressure with multi-dimensional control.

**Pressure Factors**:
- Memory pressure: 0-40 points (heap usage %)
- Concurrent streams pressure: 0-30 points (active stream count)
- Processing time pressure: 0-30 points (throughput/latency)

**Backpressure Levels**:
- NONE (0-19): Normal operation
- LIGHT (20-39): 20% speed reduction, 6 concurrent max
- MODERATE (40-59): 50% speed reduction, 3 concurrent max
- HEAVY (60-79): 75% speed reduction, 1 concurrent max
- CRITICAL (80+): System pause, emergency cleanup

**Rationale**: Single-factor backpressure is insufficient for complex streaming scenarios. Multi-factor approach provides more accurate pressure detection and appropriate responses.

**Tradeoffs**: Increased algorithmic complexity for more accurate and responsive pressure handling.

### 4. Error Recovery: Checkpoint-Based System
**Decision**: Implement checkpoint-based recovery with file integrity verification.

**Recovery Strategy**:
- Checkpoint every 5 chunks with rolling checksum
- File size/timestamp validation before recovery attempts
- Smart retry based on progress percentage and error type
- Intelligent retry strategies by error classification

**Rationale**: Restart from beginning wastes bandwidth for large files. Checkpointing enables efficient resume while maintaining data integrity.

**Tradeoffs**: Additional storage for checkpoints and increased code complexity for significant reliability improvements.

### 5. Resource Cleanup: Hierarchical Management
**Decision**: Implement priority-based resource cleanup with emergency handling.

**Cleanup Hierarchy**:
- Immediate: Critical resources, system resources
- High: Large buffers, active streams
- Normal: Standard streams, buffers
- Low: Cached resources, idle connections
- Deferred: Historical data, optional resources

**Emergency Procedures**:
- Automatic orphaned resource detection
- Emergency cleanup under memory pressure
- Priority-based resource eviction
- Garbage collection coordination

**Rationale**: Deferred cleanup improves performance but needs safeguards for memory pressure scenarios. Hierarchical approach ensures optimal resource usage.

**Tradeoffs**: More complex resource tracking for improved memory efficiency and system stability.
