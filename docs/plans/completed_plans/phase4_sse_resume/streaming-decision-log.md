# Streaming Architecture Decision Log

## Session: 2025-10-24

### Assumptions

#### Technical Assumptions
1. **File Size Range**: System needs to handle files up to 100MB+ (current limit is 100MB)
2. **Concurrent Streams**: Support for 10+ concurrent streaming operations
3. **Memory Constraints**: Strict 50MB memory ceiling for streaming operations
4. **Existing Foundation**: Current streaming implementation provides solid base for enhancements
5. **Node.js Environment**: Leverages Node.js streams and memory management capabilities

#### Business Assumptions
1. **Performance Requirements**: Minimum 10MB/second throughput is acceptable
2. **Reliability Priority**: System uptime is more important than maximum performance
3. **Incremental Delivery**: Architecture should support phased implementation
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Changes must not break existing integrations

### Accepted Tradeoffs

#### Performance vs. Complexity
- **Tradeoff**: Chose memory-first architecture over more complex flow-control
- **Reasoning**: Leverages existing patterns, reduces implementation risk
- **Impact**: May not optimize for I/O-bound scenarios, but acceptable for current use case

#### Memory vs. Throughput
- **Tradeoff**: Prioritized memory efficiency over maximum throughput
- **Reasoning**: Memory constraints are harder limits than performance targets
- **Impact**: Throughput targets (10MB/s) are conservative but achievable

#### Recovery Overhead vs. Reliability
- **Tradeoff**: Added checkpointing overhead for improved recovery capability
- **Reasoning**: Recovery costs are justified by avoiding full re-reads of large files
- **Impact**: ~5% performance overhead for checkpointing every 5 chunks

#### Cleanup Frequency vs. Performance
- **Tradeoff**: Deferred cleanup with periodic intervals vs immediate cleanup
- **Reasoning**: Improves streaming performance while maintaining safety through pressure triggers
- **Impact**: Potential temporary memory usage increase, but controlled by thresholds

### Out of Scope

#### Current Implementation
1. **Network Streaming**: Design focuses on local file streaming, not network resources
2. **Compression**: No real-time compression during streaming
3. **Encryption**: Stream encryption is handled at higher layers
4. **Distributed Streaming**: No multi-node streaming coordination

#### Future Enhancements
1. **Machine Learning Optimization**: Adaptive chunk sizing based on historical patterns
2. **Predictive Caching**: Prefetching frequently accessed file chunks
3. **Stream Pipelining**: Parallel processing of multiple chunks
4. **Resource Pools**: Advanced memory pooling for stream buffers

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

#### High-Risk Items
1. **Memory Leaks**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive resource tracking, automatic cleanup, memory monitoring
   - Detection: Memory usage monitoring, leak detection tests

2. **Performance Regression**
   - Mitigation: Baseline performance testing, gradual rollout, rollback capability
   - Detection: Automated performance benchmarks, monitoring dashboards

3. **Complex Error Scenarios**
   - Mitigation: Extensive error testing, retry mechanisms, detailed logging
   - Detection: Chaos engineering, failure injection testing

#### Medium-Risk Items
1. **Resource Contention**
   - Mitigation: Backpressure control, resource limits, priority queuing
   - Detection: Load testing, concurrent operation monitoring

2. **Checkpoint Recovery Failures**
   - Mitigation: File integrity checks, fallback to full re-read, comprehensive testing
   - Detection: Recovery success rate monitoring

### Success Criteria

#### Technical Success Metrics
- [ ] Memory usage remains <50MB for all file sizes
- [ ] Throughput ≥10MB/second for files ≥10MB
- [ ] Stream success rate ≥99.5%
- [ ] Recovery success rate ≥95%
- [ ] Zero memory leaks in 24-hour stress tests

#### Business Success Metrics
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing integrations
- [ ] Implementation completed within 6-week timeline
- [ ] Performance meets or exceeds current benchmarks
- [ ] System stability maintained under increased load

### Monitoring & Validation Plan

#### Performance Monitoring
1. **Memory Usage**: Real-time memory tracking with alerts at 45MB, 48MB, 50MB
2. **Throughput**: Per-file and aggregate throughput monitoring
3. **Error Rates**: Stream failure and recovery success tracking
4. **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, and I/O usage patterns

#### Validation Tests
1. **Large File Tests**: 100MB+ files with memory monitoring
2. **Concurrent Stream Tests**: 10+ simultaneous streams
3. **Memory Pressure Tests**: System under memory constraints
4. **Failure Recovery Tests**: Simulated interruptions and recoveries
5. **Long-running Tests**: 24-hour continuous streaming tests

### Key Architectural Decisions

#### Chunk Size Strategy
- **Decision**: Adaptive chunk sizing (32KB-256KB based on file size)
- **Rationale**: Balances memory efficiency with I/O throughput
- **Tradeoff**: Increased complexity for optimal performance

#### Memory Thresholds
- **Decision**: Lower streaming trigger from 10MB to 1MB
- **Rationale**: Prevents memory buildup with multiple files
- **Tradeoff**: Increased streaming overhead for small files

#### Backpressure Approach
- **Decision**: Multi-factor backpressure (memory + concurrency + processing time)
- **Rationale**: More accurate pressure detection than single-factor
- **Tradeoff**: Higher implementation complexity

#### Error Recovery Strategy
- **Decision**: Checkpoint-based recovery with integrity verification
- **Rationale**: Efficient recovery while ensuring data consistency
- **Tradeoff**: Additional storage and processing overhead

### Next Steps

1. **Phase 1 Approval**: Confirm core architecture approach
2. **Resource Allocation**: Assign development team for implementation
3. **Test Environment**: Setup dedicated performance testing environment
4. **Monitoring Setup**: Implement monitoring dashboards and alerts
5. **Baseline Testing**: Establish current performance benchmarks
