# ADR: Enhanced Streaming Architecture for Memory-Efficient File Reading

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-10-24

## Context

OpenSpec's current streaming implementation handles basic file streaming but needs enhancement for:
- Large file support (>100MB)
- Memory pressure handling under concurrent loads
- Robust error recovery for interrupted streams
- Systematic resource cleanup
- Adaptive performance optimization

## Decision

We chose to implement an **Enhanced Memory-First Architecture** that extends the existing streaming foundation with adaptive capabilities, rather than replacing it with a more complex flow-control or resource-aware system.

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Enhanced Memory-First Architecture (Selected)
- **Pros**: Leverages existing infrastructure, minimal disruption, proven patterns
- **Cons**: May not handle I/O-bound bottlenecks optimally
- **Risks**: Memory fragmentation under extreme load

### Option 2: Hybrid Flow-Control Architecture
- **Pros**: Better handles both memory and I/O constraints
- **Cons**: Higher complexity, requires stream pipeline redesign
- **Risks**: Integration complexity with existing error handling

### Option 3: Adaptive Resource-Aware Architecture
- **Pros**: Most efficient resource utilization, self-optimizing
- **Cons**: Highest complexity, system monitoring dependencies
- **Risks**: Over-engineering for current requirements

## Architectural Decisions

### 1. Chunk Size Strategy
**Decision**: Adaptive chunk sizing with 64KB default
- Files <1MB: 32KB chunks
- Files 1-10MB: 64KB chunks  
- Files 10-100MB: 128KB chunks
- Files â‰¥100MB: 256KB chunks

**Rationale**: Empirical testing shows 64KB provides optimal memory/throughput balance. Adaptive sizing allows optimization for different file sizes and system conditions.

### 2. Memory Thresholds
**Decision**: Multi-level threshold system with 1MB streaming trigger
- Streaming trigger: 1MB (from current 10MB)
- Warning threshold: 60% heap usage
- Critical threshold: 75% heap usage
- Maximum limit: 50MB absolute

**Rationale**: Lower streaming trigger prevents memory buildup. Multi-level thresholds enable proactive backpressure application.

### 3. Backpressure Handling
**Decision**: Multi-dimensional backpressure control
- Memory pressure score (0-40 points)
- Concurrent streams pressure (0-30 points)
- Processing time pressure (0-30 points)

**Rationale**: Single-factor backpressure is insufficient for complex streaming scenarios. Multi-factor approach provides more accurate pressure detection.

### 4. Error Recovery
**Decision**: Checkpoint-based recovery with file integrity verification
- Checkpoint every 5 chunks
- File size/timestamp validation before recovery
- Checksum verification for critical streams
- Smart retry based on progress percentage

**Rationale**: Restart from beginning wastes bandwidth for large files. Checkpointing enables efficient resume while maintaining data integrity.

### 5. Resource Cleanup
**Decision**: Priority-based cleanup with emergency handling
- Immediate cleanup for critical resources
- Normal cleanup with 30-second intervals
- Emergency cleanup under memory pressure
- Automatic orphaned resource detection

**Rationale**: Deferred cleanup improves performance but needs safeguards for memory pressure scenarios.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Architecture Enhancement (2 weeks)
Implement adaptive components while maintaining existing interface compatibility.

### Phase 2: Error Recovery & Cleanup (2 weeks)  
Add checkpointing and resource management without disrupting current error handling.

### Phase 3: Monitoring & Performance (1 week)
Integrate comprehensive metrics for performance tuning and alerting.

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation (1 week)
Extensive testing with large files, concurrent loads, and failure scenarios.

## Performance Targets

- **Memory**: Peak usage <50MB, growth <1MB/second
- **Throughput**: Minimum 10MB/second, average 25MB/second  
- **Reliability**: Stream success >99.5%, recovery success >95%
- **Latency**: 95th percentile <200ms per chunk

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Memory leaks | Comprehensive resource tracking, automatic cleanup |
| Performance regression | Baseline testing, gradual rollout, rollback capability |
| Complex error scenarios | Extensive testing, retry mechanisms, detailed logging |
| Resource contention | Backpressure control, resource limits, monitoring |

## Monitoring & Observability

Key metrics for production monitoring:
- Memory usage patterns and GC frequency
- Throughput and latency distributions
- Backpressure application frequency
- Recovery success rates
- Resource cleanup efficiency

## Consequences

This design provides:
- **Scalability**: Handles larger files and concurrent streams
- **Reliability**: Robust error recovery and resource management
- **Performance**: Adaptive optimization based on system conditions
- **Maintainability**: Modular design building on existing patterns
- **Observability**: Comprehensive metrics for operational insight

The architecture maintains backward compatibility while providing significant improvements in memory efficiency, error handling, and system reliability.
