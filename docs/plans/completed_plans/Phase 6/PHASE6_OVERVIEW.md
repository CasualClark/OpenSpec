# Phase 6 — Developer Experience & Docs (Task MCP)

**Status:** Ready to Execute • **Date:** 2025-10-25

## Objective
Make Task MCP feel effortless to try, run, and understand—**dockerless first**, one‑liner Docker second. Ship a five‑minute quickstart, copy‑paste templates, and a no‑friction Messages API example. This phase is **Task MCP–only** (Pampax integration stays out).

## Exit Criteria
- A new dev completes **open → edit → archive** on a tiny sample repo in **≤ 5 minutes**.
- One‑liner Docker run works, with `/healthz` green.
- IDE guide shows how to attach `@task:change://…` resources.
- Templates for `proposal.md` and `tasks.md` (feature/bugfix/chore) are available.
