# Architect Phase 3 Plan - Resources & IDE UX

**Date**: 2025-10-24  
**Status**: Ready for Orchestrator Delegation  
**Based on**: Phase 2 Completion Handoff + Phase 3 Implementation Plan + Phase 3 Resources & IDE UX

## Executive Summary

Phase 3 focuses on **polishing the `changes://active` pagination** and **ensuring smooth IDE resource UX**. This phase delivers critical performance improvements for large repositories and enhances the developer experience across all supported IDE platforms.

## Session Goals

Based on the Phase 2 handoff, our immediate priority is to implement:
1. **Stable pagination** with `nextPageToken` for `changes://active`
2. **Streaming resource readers** to prevent memory bloat with large files  
3. **Enhanced IDE documentation** and integration patterns
4. **Performance benchmarking** and validation
5. **Comprehensive testing** coverage

## Strategic Context

From Phase 2 completion:
- ✅ **Production-ready receipt system** with 97%+ test coverage
- ✅ **Robust validation framework** with comprehensive error handling
- ✅ **Gold-standard documentation** with 75+ production examples
- ✅ **All security boundaries** validated and approved

**Phase 3 builds on this foundation** by addressing scalability and developer experience bottlenecks that emerged during Phase 2 validation.

2. **Pagination Token Stability** 
   - **Mitigation**: Use content-based hashing and version-aware tokens
   - **Contingency**: Implement token regeneration on invalid token detection

### Medium Risk Items
3. **IDE Compatibility Across Platforms**
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing across all supported platforms
   - **Contingency**: Platform-specific workarounds documented

4. **Performance Under Load**
   - **Mitigation**: Implement connection pooling and request queuing
   - **Contingency**: Rate limiting and caching strategies

## Quality Gates

### Pre-Merge Requirements
- [ ] All unit tests passing (>95% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests passing for all IDE platforms  
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meeting thresholds
- [ ] Security review completed and approved
- [ ] Documentation reviewed and approved

### Deployment Requirements  
- [ ] Feature flags ready for gradual rollout
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Rollback plan documented and tested
- [ ] User communication prepared

## Orchestrator Execution Plan

### Week 1 (Parallel Execution)
- **Launch Task 1** (Builder): Core pagination infrastructure
- **Launch Task 2** (Engineer): Streaming resource readers
- **Monitor**: Memory usage patterns and pagination performance

### Week 2 (Dependent Execution)  
- **Launch Task 3** (Engineer): Error handling (depends on 1,2)
- **Launch Task 4** (Engineer): Performance benchmarking (depends on 1,2)
- **Launch Task 5** (Knowledge): IDE documentation (depends on 1,2)

### Week 3 (Integration & Validation)
- **Launch Task 6** (Engineer): Integration testing (depends on 1,2,3)
- **Monitor**: IDE workflow validation and performance under load

### Week 4 (Final Quality Assurance)
- **Launch Task 7** (Reviewer): Code review and QA (depends on all previous)
- **Finalize**: Deployment preparation and monitoring setup

## Decision Log

### Accepted Tradeoffs
1. **Memory vs. Simplicity**: Chose streaming readers over increased complexity
2. **Token-based Pagination**: Chose nextPageToken over offset-based for stability
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained full compatibility vs. breaking changes

### Out of Scope for Phase 3
- Advanced caching strategies (deferred to Phase 5)
- Multi-repository pagination (deferred to Phase 4) 
- Real-time change notifications (deferred to Phase 4)

## Next Steps for Orchestrator

1. **Launch Week 1 tasks** immediately (Task 1 and Task 2 in parallel)
2. **Monitor task dependencies** and launch subsequent tasks as prerequisites complete
3. **Track performance metrics** against established thresholds
4. **Coordinate weekly reviews** to assess progress and risks
5. **Prepare deployment strategy** based on task completion and quality gate results
