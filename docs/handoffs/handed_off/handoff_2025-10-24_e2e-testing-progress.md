## E2E Testing Implementation Progress Summary

### What We Accomplished
1. **Fixed Resource Providers E2E Tests (21/21 passing)**:
   - Fixed response structure inconsistencies (result.result.text vs result.result.contents.contents.text)
   - Fixed URI pattern mismatches (task:// vs tasks://)
   - Fixed concurrent test race conditions in test helpers
   - Added proper error handling for non-existent changes in task/delta resources
   - Fixed empty collection response to include 'generated' field
   - Fixed archive directory being treated as a change

2. **Fixed Phase 1 Workflow Test**:
   - Fixed changes resource provider to exclude 'archive' directory from change listings
   - Ensured archived changes are properly removed from active changes list

3. **Key Technical Fixes**:
   - Updated resource providers to use dynamic URI patterns
   - Fixed test helper functions to avoid race conditions
   - Improved error message consistency across providers
   - Enhanced security validation for resource access

### Current Status
- **Resource Providers**: ✅ 21/21 tests passing
- **Phase 1 Workflow**: ✅ Main workflow test passing  
- **Overall E2E**: 52/68 tests passing (76% pass rate)

### Remaining Issues (16 failed tests)
The remaining failures appear to be in:
1. **CLI Integration Tests** - Response structure and CLI command issues
2. **Security/Performance Tests** - Some test expectation mismatches
3. **Concurrent Operations** - Timeout issues in some stress tests

### Next Steps
1. Fix remaining CLI integration test response structures
2. Address security test expectation mismatches  
3. Resolve concurrent operation timeout issues
4. Clean up debug logging in production code

The core resource provider functionality is now solid and the main workflow works end-to-end.
