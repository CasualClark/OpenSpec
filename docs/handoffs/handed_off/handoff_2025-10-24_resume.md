## Open Risks

### Low Risk Items (Monitored)

#### 1. **Memory Usage Under Extreme Load**
- **Risk**: Memory usage could exceed 50MB with extremely large repositories (>10,000 changes)
- **Mitigation**: Implemented memory monitoring with automatic cleanup
- **Monitoring**: Performance alerts configured for >80% memory usage
- **Contingency**: Automatic fallback to buffered pagination with stricter limits

#### 2. **Pagination Token Stability During Concurrent Modifications**
- **Risk**: nextPageToken could become invalid if changes are modified during pagination
- **Mitigation**: Content-based hashing with version-aware token generation
- **Monitoring**: Token validation errors tracked in error metrics
- **Contingency**: Automatic token regeneration with user notification

#### 3. **IDE Platform Compatibility Edge Cases**
- **Risk**: Some IDE plugins may handle streaming responses differently
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing across major platforms (VS Code, JetBrains, Vim/Neovim)
- **Monitoring**: Platform-specific error tracking
- **Contingency**: Platform-specific workarounds documented in troubleshooting guide

### Medium Risk Items (Addressed)

#### 4. **Performance Degradation with High Concurrency**
- **Risk**: Response times could increase with >50 concurrent IDE connections
- **Mitigation**: Connection pooling and request queuing implemented
- **Monitoring**: Concurrent request tracking and performance alerts
- **Contingency**: Rate limiting and caching strategies ready for deployment

#### 5. **Large File Streaming Network Interruptions**
- **Risk**: Network issues could interrupt streaming of large files
- **Mitigation**: Exponential backoff retry logic with progress preservation
- **Monitoring**: Streaming failure rate tracking
- **Contingency**: Automatic fallback to buffered download on persistent failures

### No High Risk Items Remaining

All high-risk items from Phase 3 planning have been successfully mitigated through implementation and testing.
