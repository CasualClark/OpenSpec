# Example Feature Specifications

This directory contains the specification documents for the example feature change.

## Documents

- **research.md** - Research findings on existing examples and best practices
- **design.md** - Example structure and content design
- **quality.md** - Quality criteria and validation approach
- **resources.md** - Resource URI implementation examples
- **validation.md** - Example validation and accuracy checks
- **review.md** - Quality review and approval process
- **publication.md** - Publication and integration preparation
- **archive.md** - Archival and finalization documentation

## Purpose

These specifications demonstrate how to properly structure and document technical specifications within an OpenSpec change. Each document follows best practices for:

1. **Clear structure** - Organized content with logical flow
2. **Comprehensive coverage** - All aspects thoroughly documented
3. **Resource linking** - Proper use of Task MCP resource URIs
4. **Quality focus** - Emphasis on validation and review processes

## Resource URI Examples

Within these specifications, you'll find examples of Task MCP resource URIs:

- `@task:change://example-feature/proposal.md` - Link to the change proposal
- `@task:change://example-feature/tasks.md` - Link to the task breakdown
- `@task:resource://path/to/file` - Link to any project resource
- `@task:change://slug/specs/document.md` - Link to specific specification

## Usage

Use these specifications as a reference for creating your own technical specifications:

1. Follow the document structure and formatting
2. Use resource URIs to link between related documents
3. Include comprehensive quality criteria
4. Document validation and review processes
5. Plan for publication and archival

## Best Practices Demonstrated

- **Modular documentation** - Separate concerns into focused documents
- **Cross-referencing** - Use resource URIs to connect related content
- **Quality gates** - Define clear acceptance criteria
- **Process documentation** - Document how work gets done
- **Knowledge preservation** - Capture decisions and lessons learned
